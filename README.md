# Conway's Life Simulator (C++ implementation)

## Introduction

This quick personal project is an attempt to create a Maya plugin which
generates scene geometry and sets keyframes, setting the stage for an animator
to photograph the simulation in a beautiful and engaging way.

I have previously implemented this idea in Python for Blender
(https://github.com/Rjak/blenderconwayslife), but I needed a project to revive
my rusty C++ and Maya skills as well.

The resulting science short I made in Blender can be seen here:
